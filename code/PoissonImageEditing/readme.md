# Poisson Image Editing Without Mix Gradient Field #
I implemented the algorithm in the file PIEVersion4.m. 

Things you need to do before running the program:

1. Specify the source image on line 7 of the program, and specify the target image on line 9 of the program 
2. The value of the variable "flag" (in line 92 of the program) must be set to 0 before running the program.

# The optimal boundary condition for Possion image editing #
I implemented the algorithm in the file dragAndDrop.m.In the Bresenham.m file, the rasterization algorithm is implemented.In the dijkstra.m file, the shortest path algorithm is implemented.

Things you need to do before running the program:

1. Specify the source image on line 36 of the program, and specify the target image on line 37 of the program 
2. You need to specify the boundary of the object and the boundary of the area of interest. Note: The points on these two boundaries cannot overlap, otherwise the program will report an error.
